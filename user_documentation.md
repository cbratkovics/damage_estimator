**User Guide**

In order to use this program, the only preparation necessary is updating the header used to make requests to Trulia.com. Once the header is updated, all users must do is run the last line, then enter a list of ZipCodes one at a time. This program can be used to store and/or preview summary statistics estimating the value of one or more areas based on ZipCode. Simple enter the ZipCodes of interest and the program will take care of the rest. If a user makes a mistake when inputting a ZipCode, there is no need to worry. No invalid, duplicate, or nonexistent inputs will interfere with the summary statistics generated for the valid ZipCodes. All invalid or unused ZipCodes, as well as all ZipCodes used in the search will be displayed just before the summary statistics are displayed.
